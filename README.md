 Polynomial Regression using Position Salaries Dataset This project demonstrates the implementation of Polynomial Regression using the Position Salaries dataset. Polynomial Regression is a type of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (y) is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial.
